On the lower part uf the same leaf, in a srnall hand us
the ninth or tenth century, an entry has been made which
shows that at one time the MS. was in possession of the
Nunnery or Abbey οἰ St. Mary, Winchesterr The bound-
,πίω os the property hu Winchester os Queen Ealhswiss, the
soundress and benesactress of the abbey, ase the boundzu-iu
of the possessione os the abbey itselr in those days when
the entry was made. The text may be thus rendered into
En usk:—

thereupon again went along the street and over thu ὶοιάῐ theu it

Winchester, unlike other eides, has undergone com-
paratively few changes in its topography since the eighth
century. and there ren-nain sufficient prooss in the nornen-
tlature of the places to enable us to identify fairly well most
of the spots indicated within the foregoing perambulatium
¹¹ Cheap Street¹' is High Street, “king's burg hedge’¹ appears
tu have been an earthwork (before the eastern city—wall was
built) thrown up sor the defence os the ¹⁴ St. Swithun's
Bridge,¹¹ and os the mills just above it. The '‘two-sold nr
double fords¹¹ seem to have been those crossing the'¹Brooks,'’
which made the lower part of High Street almost a water—
course. The water was deeper and wider than it now is.
That the land so enclosed within the foregoing bounds
contained the site of St. Mary's Abbey must be apparent
