fourth quire (solius 20—31) is signed ilii on the lower
margin os folio 20. 11 now consists os twelve folios. A
leaf has been cut out, as is indicated hy a narrow slip along
the back. between solius 20 and 21 and another between
solius 21 and 22 ; but in each case this has been effectcd
before the scribe commenced his task on the leaves sub-
sequent to those mentioned. This quire would thus have
contained seven double pages had it boen perfect when
delivered by the master os the scriptorium to the scribe„
The fifth quire (solius 32—36) is signed ν on the lower
margin of solio 32. Originally it consisted os three double
pages, but one has been cut away between folios 32 and 33,
in this case unfortunately after the writing of the text had
been carried out. By this disaster we lose the latter
portion os the prayer, ¹‘De judicio suturo”; and what is
more to be regretted, the title os the metrical piene or
hymn to the Eucharist, the true nature os which has been,
in consequence, overlooked in the Catalngue of Ancient
Latin Manuscripts in the Eritish Museum. The sixth
quire conr-«ins only two double leaves (folios 38—41).
Some os the pages (eg¹¹ solios x, 37b, 3811, 40⁶) have
been stained. According to the authority just cited the
MS. was written in England in the Eighth century.
