HISTORY OF THE MANUSCRIPT.

immoraremur.

THERE are three aspects under which this MS.⁹² claims

consideration :—
1. The Palaeographical;

2. The Historica13 and
3. The Liturgical.

Tne PALAEoGRAPfflcAL Dascmpnou is the first to
be considered. The MS. is written on stout vellum in
forty-one leaves, measuring 8½ by 6ss inches. There are
twenty-one lines to a page in the original portion which I
have called A. The first quire, which contained the
Pession of our Lord srom the Gospels of St. Matthew and
St Mark, is wanting. It contained eight or ten double
pages. The second quire (solios 1-10) begins abruptly in
the middle of the narrative os the Passion srom the Gospel
’ of St Mark, The third quire consists os nine double pages,
(folios 11-19). Itis signed iii on the lower· margin of
solio 11. A leas has been cut out between folios 17 and 18
before the scribe began to write on the later folio, for the
sequence os the text is intact. A narrow slip running up
the back alone indicates the fact of the missing leaf. The
