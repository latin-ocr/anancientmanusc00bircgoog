of King Edward the Elder, lived and died, but it was then.
that is in Athelwold’s period, nearly ruined. The exact
words are :—“Fuerat ibi antehac monasteriolum, in qua
Edburga, reg-is Eduardi senioris Μία, mamm-ata et defitncta
flerat, scd tunc pene destnaetum,'’

William us Malmesbury, in aemi-danae with his habit os
introducing anecdota into his history. forthwith makes a
little digression respecting the love of religion which the
nobly born Edburga evinced at the early age os three
yars ; her contempt sor worldly treasures; her powers ns
converting her campaninus ς her sanctity and humility:
and, consequeutly, the mix-aclis which are connected with
her history, both in life and aster death.¹

From another passage* in the same work we gather
that some of the bones of Edburga were preserved with
constant reverence in the Abbey os Pershore, co. Worcester,
for there the glory os her miracles is more sought sor than
elsewhere.

Leland⁴ declares that Edburga evei-:many became
Abbess os this relig-tous establishment at Winchester, nur
l‘s it unlikelyr And, according to Tanner,⁵ she was finally
joined in the dedication os it with the virgin Mary.
